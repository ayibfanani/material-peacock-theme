Edit I made to the material theme for sublime text to go well with the Facebook color scheme.

Original Repo: https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme

Facebook Color Scheme: http://colorsublime.com/?q=facebook (there's a ST plugin for colorsublime if you want to grab that)

# Important Notes
 - This assumes that your Facebook color scheme is in "Packages/Colorsublime - Themes/Facebook.tmTheme" of your sublime text folder. You can change this in the Widget-Material-Theme.sublime-settings file found in the "widgets/default" folder.
 - If you have not already, download the Package Resource Viewer for Sublime Text, choose the Material Theme package. Then you can follow the installation guide.

# Installation
You can install the theme via the .zip file of this repo, or by cloning it. If you download it via the .zip file, you'll need to extract the "material theme master" folders contents into a folder. Preferably you should store the contents of that folder in a folder named "Material Theme" which would be located in your Packages directory.
After that you can edit your sublime settings file to use the theme:
```javascript
"theme": "Material-Theme.sublime-theme",
```
